    ${hash}    Get Crc32 Hash From String    ${TEST_STRING}
    Should Be Equal    ${hash}    0x8796d7bb
```

#### Generate MD5 Hash for String

```robotframework
*** Test Cases ***
Generate MD5 Hash for String
    ${hash}    Get md5 Hash From String    ${TEST_STRING}
    Should Be Equal    ${hash}    172522ec1028ab781d9dfd17eaca4427
```

#### Generate SHA256 Hash for File

```robotframework
*** Test Cases ***
Generate SHA256 Hash for File
    ${hash}    Get Sha256 Hash From File    ${TEST_FILE}
    Should Be Equal    ${hash}    <expected_sha256_hash>
```

#### Generate Base64 Hash for File

```robotframework
*** Test Cases ***
Generate Base64 Hash for File
    ${hash}    Get Base64 Hash From File    ${TEST_FILE}
    Should Be Equal    ${hash}    <expected_base64_hash>
```

#### Generate CRC32 Hash for File

```robotframework
*** Test Cases ***
Generate CRC32 Hash for File
    ${hash}    Get Crc32 Hash From File    ${TEST_FILE}
    Should Be Equal    ${hash}    <expected_crc32_hash>
```

#### Generate MD5 Hash for File

```robotframework
*** Test Cases ***
Generate MD5 Hash for File
    ${hash}    Get md5 Hash From File    ${TEST_FILE}
    Should Be Equal    ${hash}    <expected_md5_hash>
```
